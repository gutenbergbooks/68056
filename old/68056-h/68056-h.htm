<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c018'>THE nature and effects of that unhappy
and disgraceful branch of commerce,
which has long been maintained on the Coast
of Africa, with the sole, and professed design
of purchasing our fellow-creatures, in order
to supply our West-India islands and the American
colonies, when they were ours, with
Slaves; is now generally understood. So much
light has been thrown upon the subject, by
many able pens; and so many respectable persons
have already engaged to use their utmost
influence, for the suppression of a traffic, which
contradicts the feelings of humanity; that it
is hoped, this stain of our National character
will soon be wiped out.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>If I attempt, after what has been done, to
throw my mite into the public stock of information,
it is less from an apprehension that
my interference is necessary, than from a conviction,
that silence, at such a time, and on
such an occasion, would, in me, be criminal.
If my testimony should not be necessary, or
serviceable, yet, perhaps, I am bound, in conscience,
to take shame to myself by a public
confession, which, however sincere, comes too
late to prevent, or repair, the misery and mischief
to which I have, formerly, been accessary.</p>

<p class='c019'>I hope it will always be a subject of humiliating
reflection to me, that I was, once, an
active instrument, in a business at which my
heart now shudders. My headstrong passions
and follies plunged me, in early life, into a
succession of difficulties and hardships, which,
at length, reduced me to seek a refuge among
the Natives of Africa. There, for about the
space of eighteen months, I was in effect,
though without the name, a Captive and a
Slave myself; and was depressed to the lowest
degree of human wretchedness. Possibly, I
should not have been so completely miserable,
had I lived among the Natives only, but it
was my lot to reside with white men; for at
that time, several persons of my own colour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>and language were settled upon that part of the
Windward coast, which lies between Sierra-Leon
and Cape Mount; for the purpose of
purchasing and collecting Slaves, to sell to the
vessels that arrived from Europe.</p>

<p class='c019'>This is a bourn, from which few travellers
return, who have once determined to venture
upon a temporary residence there; but the good
providence of God, without my expectation,
and almost against my will, delivered me from
those scenes of wickedness and woe; and I arrived
at Liverpool in May 1748. I soon revisited
the place of my captivity, as mate of a
ship, and, in the year 1750, I was appointed
commander, in which capacity I made three
voyages to the Windward Coast, for Slaves.</p>

<p class='c019'>I first saw the Coast of Guinea in the year
1745, and took my last leave of it in 1754.
It was not, intentionally, a farewel; but through
the mercy of God it proved so. I fitted out
for a fourth voyage, and was upon the point
of sailing, when I was arrested by a sudden
illness, and I resigned the ship to another Captain.</p>

<p class='c019'>Thus I was unexpectedly freed from this
disagreeable service. Disagreeable I had long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>found it; but I think I should have quitted it
sooner, had I considered it, as I now do, to be
unlawful and wrong. But I never had a scruple
upon this head at the time; nor was such
a thought once suggested to me, by any friend.
What I did, I did ignorantly; considering it
as the line of life which Divine Providence
had allotted me, and having no concern, in
point of conscience, but to treat the Slaves,
while under my care, with as much humanity
as a regard to my own safety would admit.</p>

<p class='c019'>The experience and observation of nine
years, would qualify me for being a competent
witness upon this subject, could I safely
trust to the report of Memory, after an interval
of more than thirty-three years. But, in the
course of so long a period, the ideas of past
scenes and transactions, grow indistinct; and I
am aware, that what I have seen, and what I
have only heard related, may, by this time,
have become so insensibly blended together,
that, in some cases, it may be difficult for me,
if not impossible, to distinguish them, with
absolute certainty. It is, however, my earnest
desire, and will therefore engage my utmost
care, that I may offer nothing in writing, as
from my own knowledge, which I could not
chearfully, if requisite, confirm upon oath.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>That part of the African shore, which lies
between the river Sierra-Leon, lat. 8. 30. N.
and Cape Palmas, is usually known by the
name of the Windward, or Grain Coast. The
extent (if my recollection does not fail me) is
about one hundred and fifty leagues. There
is a fort upon Benee Island, in Sierra-Leon,
which formerly belonged to the old African
Company: they also had a fort on an island
in the river Sherbro; but the former was in
private hands, and of the latter, scarcely the
foundations were visible, when I first went to
Africa. There is no fort, or factory, upon
this coast, under the sanction of our Government;
but there were, as I have said, and
probably still are, private traders resident at
Benee Island, at the Bananoes, and at the
Plantanes. The former of these is about twelve,
and the latter twenty leagues, from Sierra-Leon,
to the South-East.</p>

<p class='c019'>By these persons, the trade is carried on, in boats
and shallops, thirty or forty leagues to the northward,
in several rivers lying within the shoals
of Rio Grande. But the most northerly place
of trade, for shipping, is Sierra-Leon, and the
business there, and in that neighbourhood, is
chiefly transacted with the white men: but
from Sherbro to Cape Palmas, directly with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>the natives. Though I have been on the Gold
Coast, and beyond it as far as Cape Lopez, in
the latitude of one or two degrees South, I profess
no knowledge of the African trade, but
as it was conducted on the Windward Coast
when I was concerned in it.</p>

<p class='c019'>I am not qualified, and if I were, I should
think it rather unsuitable to my present character,
as a Minister of the Gospel, to consider
the African Slave Trade, merely, in a political
light. This disquisition more properly belongs
to persons in civil life. Only thus far
my character as a Minister will allow, and perhaps
require me, to observe, that the best Human
Policy, is that which is connected with a
reverential regard to Almighty God, the Supreme
Governor of the Earth. Every plan, which
aims at the welfare of a nation, in defiance of
his authority and laws, however apparently
wise, will prove to be essentially defective,
and, if persisted in, ruinous. The Righteous
Lord loveth Righteousness, and He has engaged
to plead the cause, and vindicate the
wrongs of the oppressed. It is Righteousness
that exalted a nation; and Wickedness is the
present reproach, and will, sooner or later,
unless repentance intervene, prove the ruin of
any people.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Perhaps what I have said of myself may
be applicable to the nation at large. The
Slave Trade was always unjustifiable; but inattention
and interest prevented, for a time, the
evil from being perceived. It is otherwise
at present; the mischiefs and evils, connected
with it, have been, of late years, represented
with such undeniable evidence, and are now
so generally known, that I suppose there is
hardly an objection can be made, to the wish
of thousands, perhaps of millions, for the suppression
of this Trade, but upon the ground of
political expedience,</p>

<p class='c019'>Tho’ I were even sure, that a principal branch
of the public revenue depended upon the African
Trade (which, I apprehend, is far from being the
case), if I had access and influence, I should
think myself bound to say to Government, to
Parliament, and to the Nation, “It is not lawful
to put it into the Treasury, because it is
the price of blood<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c020'><sup>[1]</sup></a>.”</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c021'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Matth. xxvii. 6.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c019'>I account an intelligent Farmer to be a good
Politician, in this sense; that, if he has a
large heap of good corn, he will not put a
small quantity, that is damaged, to the rest,
for the sake of encreasing the heap. He knows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>that such an addition would spoil the whole.
God forbid, that any supposed profit or advantage,
which we can derive from the groans
and agonies, and blood of the poor Africans,
should draw down his heavy curse, upon all
that we might, otherwise, honourably and
comfortably possess.</p>

<p class='c019'>For the sake of Method, I could wish to
consider the African Trade,—First, with regard
to the effects it has upon our own people; and
Secondly, as it concerns the Blacks, or, as
they <i>are</i> more contemptuously styled, the
Negroe Slaves, whom we purchase upon the
Coast. But these two topics are so interwoven
together, that it will not be easy to keep them
exactly separate.</p>

<p class='c019'>1. The first point I shall mention is surely
of political importance, if the lives of our
fellow-subjects be so; and if a rapid loss of
Seamen deserves the attention of a maritime
people. This loss, in the African Trade, is
truly alarming. I admit, that many of them
are cut off in their first voyage, and, consequently,
before they can properly rank as Seamen;
though they would have been Seamen,
if they had lived. But the neighbourhood of
our sea-ports is continually drained, of men
and boys, to supply the places of those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>die abroad; and if they are not all Seamen,
they are all our brethren and countrymen,
subjects of the British Government.</p>

<p class='c019'>The people who remain, on ship-board,
upon the open coast, if not accustomed to the
climate, are liable to the attack of an inflammatory
fever, which is not often fatal, unless
the concurrence of unfavourable circumstances
makes it so. When this danger is over, I
think they might, probably, be as healthy
as in most other voyages; provided, they
could be kept from sleeping in the dews, from
being much exposed to the rain, from the intemperate
use of spirits, and especially from
women.</p>

<p class='c019'>But, considering the general disposition of
our Sailors, and the nature of the Slave Trade,
these provisos are of little more significance,
than if I should say, upon another occasion,
that Great-Britain would be a happy country,
<i>provided</i>, all the inhabitants were Wise, and
Good. The Sailors <i>must be</i> much exposed to
the weather; especially on the Windward
Coast, where a great part of the cargo is procured
by boats, which are often sent to the
distance of thirty or forty leagues, and are
sometimes a month before they return. Many
vessels arrive upon the coast before the rainy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>season, which continues from about May to
October, is over; and if trade be scarce, the
ships which arrive in the fair, or dry season,
often remain till the rains return, before they
can complete their purchase. A proper shelter
from the weather, in an open boat, when the
rain is incessant night and day, for weeks and
months, is impracticable.</p>

<p class='c019'>I have myself, in such a boat, been five or
six days together, without, as we say, a dry
thread about me, sleeping or waking. And
during the fair season, Tornadoes, or violent
storms of wind, thunder, and heavy rain, are
very frequent, though they seldom last long.
In fact, the boats seldom return, without
bringing some of the people ill of dangerous
fevers or fluxes, occasioned either by the weather,
or by unwholesome diet, such as the
crude fruits and palm wine, with which they
are plentifully supplied by the natives.</p>

<p class='c019'>Strong liquors, such as brandy, rum, or
English spirits, the Sailors cannot often procure,
in such quantities as to hurt them; but
they will, if they can; and opportunities
sometimes offer, especially to those who are
in the boats; for strong liquor being an article
much in demand, so that, without it, scarcely
a single Slave can be purchased, it is always at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>hand. And if what is taken from the casks
or bottles, that are for sale, be supplied with
water, they are as full as they were before.
The Blacks, who buy the liquor, are the
losers by the adulteration; but often the
people, who cheat them, are the greatest sufferers.</p>

<p class='c019'>The article of Women, likewise, contributes
largely to the loss of our Seamen. When they
are on shore, they often, from their known,
thoughtless imprudence, involve themselves,
on this account, in quarrels with the Natives,
and, if not killed upon the spot, are frequently
poisoned. On ship-board, they may be restrained,
and in some ships they are; but such
restraint is far from being general. It depends
much upon the disposition, and attention, of
the Captain. When I was in the trade, I
knew several commanders of African ships,
who were prudent, respectable men, and who
maintained a proper discipline and regularity
in their vessels; but there were too many of a
different character. In some ships, perhaps in
the most, the license allowed, in this particular,
was almost unlimited. Moral turpitude
was seldom considered, but they who took care
to do the ship’s business, might, in other respects,
do what they pleased. These excesses,
if they do not induce fevers, at least, render the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>constitution less able to support them; and
lewdness, too frequently, terminates in death.</p>

<p class='c019'>The risk of insurrections is to be added.
These, I believe, are always meditated; for
the Men Slaves are not, easily, reconciled to
their confinement, and treatment; and if attempted,
they are seldom suppressed without
considerable loss; and sometimes they succeed,
to the destruction of a whole ship’s company
at once. Seldom a year passes, but we hear
of one or more such catastrophes: and we
likewise hear, sometimes, of Whites and Blacks
involved, in one moment, in one common
ruin, by the gunpowder taking fire, and blowing
up the ship.</p>

<p class='c019'>How far the several causes, I have enumerated,
may respectively operate, I cannot say:
the fact however is sure, that a great number
of our Seamen perish in the Slave Trade. Few
ships, comparatively, are either blown up, or
totally cut off, but some are. Of the rest, I
have known some that have lost half their
people, and some a larger proportion. I am
far from saying, that it is always, or even
often, thus; but, I believe, I shall state the
matter sufficiently low, if I suppose, that, at
least, one fifth part of those who go from
England to the Coast of Africa, in ships which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>trade for Slaves, never return from thence.
I dare not depend, too much, upon my memory,
as to the number of ships, and men, employed
in the Slave Trade more than thirty years ago;
nor do I know what has been the state of the
trade since; therefore I shall not attempt to
make calculations. But, as I cannot but form
some opinion upon the subject, I judge it probable,
that the collective sum of Seamen,
who go, from all our ports, to Africa, within
the course of a year, (taking Guinea in the
extensive sense, from Goree or Gambia, and
including the coast of Angola,) cannot be less
than eight thousand; and if, upon an average
of ships and seasons, a fifth part of these die,
the annual loss is fifteen hundred. I believe
those, who have taken pains to make more
exact enquiries, will deem my supposition to
be very moderate.</p>

<p class='c019'>Thus much concerning the first evil, the
Loss of Seamen and Subjects, which the nation
sustains, by the African Slave Trade.</p>

<p class='c019'>2. There is a second, which either is, or
ought to be, deemed of importance, considered
in a political light. I mean, the dreadful effects
of this trade, upon the minds of those
who are engaged in it. There are, doubtless,
exceptions, and I would, willingly, except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>myself. But, in general, I know of no method
of getting money, not even that of robbery,
for it, upon the highway, which has a
more direct tendency to efface the moral sense,
to rob the heart of every gentle and humane
disposition, and to harden it, like steel, against
all impressions of sensibility.</p>

<p class='c019'>Usually, about two-thirds of a cargo of
Slaves are males. When a hundred and fifty
or two hundred stout men, torn from their
native land, many of whom never saw the sea,
much less a ship, till a short space before they
are embarked; who have, probably, the same
natural prejudice against a white man, as we
have against a black; and who often bring with
them an apprehension that they are bought to
be eaten: I say, when thus circumstanced, it
is not to be expected that they will, tamely,
resign themselves to their situation. It is always
taken for granted, that they will attempt
to gain their liberty, if possible. Accordingly,
as we dare not trust them, we receive them on
board, from the first, as enemies: and before
their number exceeds, perhaps, ten or fifteen,
they are all put in irons; in most ships, two
and two together. And frequently, they are
not thus confined, as they might, most conveniently,
stand or move, the right hand and
foot of one to the left of the other; but across,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>that is, the hand and foot of each on the same
side, whether right or left, are fettered together:
so that they cannot move, either hand
or foot, but with great caution, and with perfect,
consent. Thus they must sit, walk and
lie, for many months, (sometimes for nine or
ten,) without any mitigation or relief, unless
they are sick.</p>

<p class='c019'>In the night they are confined below, in
the day-time (if the weather be fine) they are
upon deck; and as they are brought up, by
pairs, a chain is put through a ring upon their
irons, and this is likewise locked down to the
ring-bolts, which are fastened at certain intervals
upon the deck. These, and other precautions,
are no more than necessary; especially,
as while the number of Slaves increases,
that of the people, who are to guard
them, is diminished, by sickness, or death, or
by being absent in the boats: so that, sometimes,
not ten men can be mustered, to watch,
night and day, over two hundred, besides
having all the other business of the ship to
attend.</p>

<p class='c019'>That these precautions are so often effectual,
is much more to be wondered at, than that
they sometimes fail. One unguarded hour,
or minute, is sufficient to give the Slaves the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>opportunity they are always waiting for. An
attempt to rise upon the ship’s company, brings
on instantaneous and horrid war; for, when
they are once in motion, they are desperate;
and where they do not conquer, they are seldom
quelled without much mischief and bloodshed,
on both sides.</p>

<p class='c019'>Sometimes, when the Slaves are ripe for an
insurrection, one of them will impeach the
affairs; and then necessity, and the state policy,
of these small, but most absolute governments,
enforce maxims directly contrary to
the nature of things. The traitor to the
cause of liberty is caressed, rewarded, and
deemed an honest fellow. The patriots, who
formed and animated the plan, if they can be
found out, must be treated as villains, and
punished, to intimidate the rest. These punishments,
in their nature and degree, depend
upon the sovereign will of the Captain. Some
are content with inflicting such moderate punishment,
as may suffice for an example. But
unlimited power, instigated by revenge, and
where the heart, by a long familiarity with
the sufferings of Slaves, is become callous,
and insensible to the pleadings of humanity,
is terrible.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>I have seen them sentenced to unmerciful
whippings, continued till the poor creatures
have not had power to groan under their
misery, and hardly a sign of life has remained.
I have seen them agonizing for hours, I believe,
for days together, under the torture of
the thumb-screws; a dreadful engine, which,
if the screw be turned by an unrelenting hand,
can give intolerable anguish. There have
been instances in which cruelty has proceeded
still further; but, as I hope they are few, and
I can mention but one, from my own knowledge,
I shall but mention it.</p>

<p class='c019'>I have often heard a Captain, who has been
long since dead, boast of his conduct in a
former voyage, when his Slaves attempted to
rise upon him. After he had suppressed the
insurrection, he sat in judgment upon the insurgents;
and not only, in cold blood, adjudged
several of them, I know not how
many, to die, but studied, with no small
attention, how to make death as excruciating
to them as possible. For my reader’s sake, I
suppress the recital of particulars.</p>

<p class='c019'>Surely, it must be allowed, that they who
are long conversant with such scenes as these,
are liable to imbibe a spirit of ferociousness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>and savage insensibility, of which human nature,
depraved as it is, is not, ordinarily, capable.
If these things be true, the reader will
admit the possibility of a fact, that was in
current report, when I was upon the Coast, and
the truth of which, though I cannot now authenticate
it, I have no reason to doubt.</p>

<p class='c019'>A Mate of a ship, in a long-boat, purchased
a young woman, with a fine child, of about a
year old, in her arms. In the night, the
child cried much, and disturbed his sleep. He
rose up in great anger, and swore, that if the
child did not cease making such a noise, he
would presently silence it. The child continued
to cry. At length he rose up a second
time, tore the child from the mother, and
threw it into the sea. The child was soon
silenced indeed, but it was not so easy to
pacify the woman: she was too valuable to be
thrown overboard, and he was obliged to bear
the sound of her lamentations, till he could put
her on board his ship.</p>

<p class='c019'>I am persuaded, that every tender mother
who feasts her eyes and her mind, when she
contemplates the infant in her arms, will commiserate
the poor Africans.—But why do I
speak of one child, when we have heard and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>read a melancholy story, too notoriously true
to admit of contradiction, of more than a
hundred grown slaves, thrown into the sea, at
one time, from on board a ship, when fresh
water was scarce; to fix the loss upon the
Underwriters, which otherwise, had they died
on board, must have fallen upon the Owners of
the vessel. These instances are specimens of
the spirit produced, by the African Trade, in
men, who, once, were no more destitute of
the milk of human kindness than ourselves.</p>

<p class='c019'>Hitherto, I have considered the condition of
the Men Slaves only. From the Women,
there is no danger of insurrection, and they
are carefully kept from the men; I mean,
from the Black men. But——In what I have
to offer, on this head, I am far from including
every ship. I speak not of what is universally,
but of what is too commonly, and, I am afraid,
too generally, prevalent.</p>

<p class='c019'>I have already observed, that the Captain of
an African ship, while upon the Coast, is absolute
in his command; and if he be humane,
vigilant, and determined, he has it in his
power to protect the miserable; for scarcely
any thing can be done, on board the ship,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>without his permission, or connivance. But
this power is, too seldom, exerted in favour of
the poor Women Slaves.</p>

<p class='c019'>When we hear of a town taken by storm,
and given up to the ravages of an enraged and
licentious army, of wild and unprincipled
Cossacks, perhaps no part of the distress affects
a feeling mind more, than the treatment to
which the women are exposed.  But the
enormities frequently committed, in an African
ship, though equally flagrant, are little known
<i>here</i>, and are considered, <i>there</i>, only as matters
of course.  When the Women and Girls are
taken on board a ship, naked, trembling, terrified,
perhaps almost exhausted with cold,
fatigue, and hunger, they are often exposed to
the wanton rudeness of white Savages. The
poor creatures cannot understand the language
they hear, but the looks and manner of the
speakers, are sufficiently intelligible. In imagination,
the prey is divided, upon the spot,
and only reserved till opportunity offers.
Where resistance, or refusal, would be utterly
in vain, even the solicitation of consent is
seldom thought of. But I forbear.—This is
not a subject for declamation. Facts like
these, so certain, and so numerous, speak for
themselves. Surely, if the advocates for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>the Slave Trade attempt to plead for it, before
the Wives and Daughters of our happy
land, or before those who have Wives or
Daughters of their own, they must lose their
cause.</p>

<p class='c019'>Perhaps some hard-hearted pleader may
suggest, that such treatment would indeed be
cruel, in Europe; but the African Women are
Negroes, Savages, who have no idea of the nicer
sensations which obtain among civilized people.
I dare contradict them in the strongest terms.
I have lived long, and conversed much,
amongst these supposed Savages. I have often
slept in their towns, in a house filled with
goods for trade, with no person in the house
but myself, and with no other door than a
mat; in that security, which no man in
his senses would expect, in this civilized
nation, especially in this metropolis, without
the precaution of having strong doors,
strongly locked and bolted. And with regard
to the women, in Sherbro, where I
was most acquainted, I have seen many
instances of modesty, and even delicacy,
which would not disgrace an English woman.
Yet, such is the treatment which I have known
permitted, if not encouraged, in many of our
ships—they have been abandoned, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>restraint, to the lawless will of the first
comer.</p>

<p class='c019'>Accustomed thus to despise, insult, and injure
the Slaves on board, it may be expected
that the conduct of many of our people to the
Natives, with whom they trade, is, as far as
circumstances admit, very similar; and it is
so. They are considered as a people to be
robbed and spoiled, with impunity. Every
art is employed to deceive, and wrong them.
And he who has most address, in this way,
has most to boast of.</p>

<p class='c019'>Not an article, that is capable of diminution
or adulteration, is delivered genuine, or
entire. The spirits are lowered by water.
False heads are put into the kegs that contain
the gun-powder; so that, though the keg appears
large, there is no more powder in it,
than in a much smaller. The linen and cotton
cloths are opened, and two or three yards,
according to the length of the piece, cut off,
not from the end, but out of the middle,
where it is not so readily noticed.</p>

<p class='c019'>The Natives are cheated, in the number,
weight, measure, or quality, of what they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>purchase, in every possible way. And, by
habit and emulation, a marvellous dexterity is
acquired in these practices. And thus the
Natives, in their turn, in proportion to their
commerce with the Europeans, and (I am
sorry to add) particularly with the English,
become jealous, insidious and revengeful.</p>

<p class='c019'>They know with whom they deal, and are
accordingly prepared;—though they can trust
some ships and boats, which have treated them
with punctuality, and may be trusted by them.
A quarrel, sometimes, furnishes pretext for
detaining, and carrying away, one or more of
the Natives, which is retaliated, if practicable,
upon the next boat that comes to the place,
from the same port. For so far their vindictive
temper is restrained by their ideas of justice,
that they will not, often, revenge an injury
received from a Liverpool ship, upon one belonging
to Bristol or London.</p>

<p class='c019'>They will, usually, wait with patience, the
arrival of one, which, they suppose, by her
sailing from the same place, has some connection
with that which used them ill; and they
are so quick at distinguishing our little local
differences of language, and customs in a ship,
that before they have been in a ship five minutes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>and often before they come on board,
they know, with certainty, whether she be
from Bristol, Liverpool, or London.</p>

<p class='c019'>Retaliation on their parts, furnishes a plea
for reprizal on ours. Thus, in one place or
another, trade is often suspended, all intercourse
cut off, and things are in a state of war;
till necessity, either on the ship’s part, or on
theirs, produces overtures of peace, and dictates
the price, which the offending party must
pay for it. But it is a warlike peace. We
trade under arms; and they are furnished with
long knives.</p>

<p class='c019'>For, with a few exceptions, the English
and the Africans, reciprocally, consider each
other as consummate villains, who are always
watching opportunities to do mischief. In
short, we have, I fear too deservedly, a very
unfavourable character upon the Coast. When
I have charged a Black with unfairness and
dishonesty, he has answered, if able to clear
himself, with an air of disdain, “What! do
you think I am a White Man?”</p>

<p class='c019'>Such is the nature, such are the concomitants,
of the Slave Trade; and such is the
school in which many thousands of our Seamen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>are brought up. Can we then wonder at that
impatience of subordination, and that disposition
to mutiny, amongst them, which has
been, of late, so loudly complained of, and so
severely felt? Will not sound policy suggest,
the necessity, of some expedient here? Or can
sound policy suggest any, effectual, expedient,
but the total suppression of a Trade, which,
like a poisonous root, diffuses its malignity into
every branch?</p>

<p class='c019'>The effects which our trade has upon the
Blacks, those especially who come under our
power, may be considered under three heads,—How
they are acquired? The mortality they
are subject to! and, How those who survive
are disposed of?</p>

<p class='c019'>I confine my remarks on the first head to
the Windward Coast, and can speak most confidently
of the trade in Sherbro, where I lived.
I own, however, that I question, if any part of
the Windward Coast is equal to Sherbro, in
point of regularity and government. They
have no men of great power or property
among them; as I am told there are upon the
Gold Coast, at Whidah and Benin. The
Sherbro people live much in the patriarchal
way. An old man usually presides in each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>town, whose authority depends more on his
years, than on his possessions: and He, who
is called the King, is not easily distinguished,
either by state or wealth, from the rest. But
the different districts, which seem to be, in
many respects, independent of each other, are
incorporated, and united, by means of an institution
which pervades them all, and is called
The <i>Purrow</i>. The persons of this order, who
are very numerous, seem, very much, to resemble
the Druids, who once presided in our
island.</p>

<p class='c019'>The <i>Purrow</i> has both the legislative and
executive authority, and, under their sanction,
there is a police exercised, which is by no
means contemptible. Every thing belonging
to the <i>Purrow</i> is mysterious and severe, but,
upon the whole, it has very good effects; and
as any man, whether bond or free, who will
submit to be initiated into their mysteries, may
be admitted of the Order, it is a kind of
Common-wealth. And, perhaps, few people
enjoy more, simple, political freedom, than the
inhabitants of Sherbro, belonging to the <i>Purrow</i>,
(who are not slaves,) further than they
are bound by their own institutions. Private
property is tolerably well secured, and violence
is much suppressed.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>The state of Slavery, among these wild barbarous
people, as we esteem them, is much
milder than in our colonies. For as, on the
one hand, they have no land in high cultivation,
like our West-India plantations, and
therefore no call for that excessive, unintermitted
labour, which exhausts our Slaves; so,
on the other hand, no man is permitted to
draw blood, even from a Slave. If he does,
he is liable to a strict inquisition; for the
<i>Purrow</i> laws will not allow a private individual
to shed blood. A man may sell his slave,
if he pleases; but he may not wantonly abuse
him. The laws likewise punish some species
of theft, with slavery; and in cases of adultery,
which are very common, as polygamy is
the custom of the country, both the woman,
and the man who offends with her, are liable
to be sold for Slaves, unless they can satisfy
the husband, or unless they are redeemed by
their friends.</p>

<p class='c019'>Among these unenlightened Blacks, it is a
general maxim, that if a man steals, or breaks
a moveable, as a musket, for instance, the offence
may be nearly compensated, by putting
another musket in its place; but offences,
which cannot be repaired in kind, as adultery,
admit of no satisfaction, till the injured person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>declares, that He is satisfied. So that, if a
rich man seduces the wife of a poor man, he
has it in his power to change places with him;
for he may send for every article in his house,
one by one, till he says, “I have enough.”
The only alternative, is personal slavery.</p>

<p class='c019'>I suppose, bribery and influence may have
their effects in Guinea, as they have in some
other countries; but their laws, in the main,
are wise and good, and, upon the whole, they
have considerable operation; and therefore, I
believe, many of the Slaves purchased in
Sherbro, and probably upon the whole Windward
Coast, are convicts, who have forfeited
their liberty, by breaking the laws of their
country.</p>

<p class='c019'>But, I apprehend, that the neighbourhood
of our ships, and the desire of our goods, are
motives, which often push the rigour of the
laws to an extreme, which would not be exacted,
if they were left to themselves.</p>

<p class='c019'>But Slaves are the staple article of the traffic;
and though a considerable number may have
been born near the sea, I believe the bulk, of
them are brought from far. I have reason to
think, that some travel more than a thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>miles, before they reach the sea-coast. Whether
there may be convicts amongst these likewise,
or what proportion they may bear to
those who are taken prisoners in war, it is impossible
to know.</p>

<p class='c019'>I judge, the principal source of the Slave
Trade, is, the wars which prevail among the
Natives. Sometimes, these wars break out
between those who live near the sea. The
English, and other Europeans, have been
charged with fomenting them; I believe
(so far as concerns the Windward Coast) unjustly.
That some would do it, if they could,
I doubt not; but I do not think they can have
opportunity. Nor is it needful they should
interfere. Thousands, in our own country,
wish for war, because they fatten upon its
spoils.</p>

<p class='c019'>Human nature is much the same in every
place, and few people will be willing to allow,
that the <i>Negroes</i> in Africa are better than themselves.
Supposing, therefore, they wish for
European goods, may not they wish to purchase
them from a ship just arrived? Of
course, they must wish for Slaves to go to
market with; and if they have not Slaves,
and think themselves strong enough to invade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>their neighbours, they will probably wish for
war.—And if once they wish for it, how easy
is it to find, or make, pretexts for breaking an
inconvenient peace; or (after the example of
greater heroes, of Christian name) to make
depredations, without condescending to assign
any reasons.</p>

<p class='c019'>I verily believe, that the far greater part of
the wars, in Africa, would cease; if the Europeans
would cease to tempt them, by offering
goods for Slaves. And though they do
not bring legions into the field, their wars are
bloody. I believe, the captives reserved for
sale, are fewer than the slain.</p>

<p class='c019'>I have not sufficient data to warrant calculation,
but, I suppose, not less than one hundred
thousand Slaves are exported, annually, from all
parts of Africa, and that more than one half, of
these, are exported in English bottoms.</p>

<p class='c019'>If but an equal number are killed in war,
and if many of these wars are kindled by
the incentive of selling their prisoners; what
an annual accumulation of blood must there
be, crying against the nations of Europe concerned
in this trade, and particularly against
our own!</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>I have, often, been gravely told, as a proof
that the Africans, however hardly treated,
deserve but little compassion, that they are a
people so destitute of natural affection, that it
is common, among them, for parents to sell
their children, and children their parents.
And, I think, a charge, of this kind, is
brought against them, by the respectable author
of <i>Spectacle de la Nature</i>. But he must
have been misinformed. I never heard of one
instance of either, while I used the Coast.</p>

<p class='c019'>One article more, upon this head, is Kidnapping,
or stealing free people. Some people
suppose, that the Ship Trade is rather the
stealing, than the buying of Slaves. But
there is enough to lay to the charge of the
ships, without accusing them falsely. The
slaves, in general, are bought, and paid for.
Sometimes, when goods are lent, or trusted
on shore, the trader voluntarily leaves a free
person, perhaps his own son, as a hostage, or
pawn, for the payment; and, in case of default,
the hostage is carried off, and sold;
which, however hard upon him, being in
consequence of a free stipulation, cannot be
deemed unfair. There have been instances of
unprincipled Captains, who, at the close of
what they supposed their last voyage, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>when they had no intention of revisiting the
Coast, have detained, and carried away, free
people with them; and left the next ship,
that should come from the same port, to risk
the consequences. But these actions, I hope,
and believe, are not common.</p>

<p class='c019'>With regard to the Natives, to steal a free
man or woman, and to sell them on board a
ship, would, I think, be a more difficult, and
more dangerous attempt, in Sherbro, than in
London. But I have no doubt, that the
traders who come, from the interior parts of
Africa, at a great distance, find opportunity,
in the course of their journey, to pick up
stragglers, whom they may meet in their way.
This branch of oppression, and robbery,
would likewise fail, if the temptation to it
were removed.</p>

<p class='c019'>I have, to the best of my knowledge,
pointed out the principal sources, of that immense
supply of Slaves, which furnishes so
large an exportation every year. If all that
are taken on board the ships, were to survive
the voyage, and be landed in good order, possibly
the English, French, and Dutch islands,
and colonies, would be soon overstocked, and
fewer ships would sail to the Coast. But a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>large abatement must be made for mortality.—After
what I have already said of their treatment,
I shall now, that I am again to consider
them on board the ships, confine myself to
this point.</p>

<p class='c019'>In the Portuguese ships, which trade from
Brasil to the Gold Coast and Angola, I believe
a heavy mortality is not frequent. The
Slaves have room, they are not put in irons,
(I speak from information only,) and are humanely
treated.</p>

<p class='c019'>With our ships the great object is, to be
full. When the ship is there, it is thought
desirable, she should take as many as possible.
The cargo of a vessel of a hundred tons, or
little more, is calculated to purchase from
two hundred and twenty to two hundred and
fifty Slaves. Their lodging-rooms below the
deck, which are three, (for the men, the
boys, and the women,) besides a place for the
sick, are sometimes more than five feet high,
and sometimes less; and this height is divided
towards the middle, for the Slaves lie in two
rows, one above the other, on each side of
the ship, close to each other, like books
upon a shelf. I have known them so close,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>that the shelf would not, easily, contain one
more.</p>

<p class='c019'>And I have known a white man sent down
among the men, to lay them in these rows
to the greatest advantage, so that as little
space as possible might be lost. Let it be
observed, that the poor creatures, thus
cramped for want of room, are likewise in
irons, for the most part both hands and feet,
and two together, which makes it difficult
for them to turn or move, to attempt either
to rise or to lie down, without hurting themselves,
or each other. Nor is the motion of
the ship, especially her heeling, or stoop on
one side, when under sail, to be admitted; for
this, as they lie athwart, or across the ship,
adds to the uncomfortableness of their lodging,
especially to those who lie on the leeward, or
leaning side of the vessel.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Dire is the tossing, deep the groans.——</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The heat and the smell of these rooms,
when the weather will not admit of the Slaves
being brought upon deck, and of having
their rooms cleaned every day, would be, almost,
insupportable, to a person not accustomed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>to them. If the Slaves and their rooms
can be constantly aired, and they are not detained
too long on board, perhaps there are not
many who die; but the contrary is often their
lot. They are kept down, by the weather, to
breathe a hot and corrupted air, sometimes
for a week: this, added to the galling of their
irons, and the despondency which seizes their
spirits, when thus confined, soon becomes
fatal. And every morning, perhaps, more
instances than one are found, of the living
and the dead, like the Captives of Mezentius,
fastened together.</p>

<p class='c019'>Epidemical fevers and fluxes, which fill
the ship with noisome and noxious effluvia,
often break out, infect the Seamen likewise,
and the Oppressors, and the Oppressed, fall by
the same stroke. I believe, nearly one half of
the Slaves on board, have, sometimes, died;
and that the loss of a third part, in these circumstances,
is not unusual. The ship, in
which I was Mate, left the Coast with Two
Hundred and Eighteen Slaves on board; and
though we were not much affected by epidemical
disorders, I find, by my journal of that
voyage, (now before me,) that we buried
Sixty-two on our passage to South-Carolina,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>exclusive of those which died before we left
the Coast, of which I have no account.</p>

<p class='c019'>I believe, upon an average between the
more healthy, and the more sickly voyages,
and including all contingencies, One Fourth
of the whole purchase may be allotted to the
article of Mortality. That is, if the English
ships purchase <i>Sixty Thousand</i> Slaves annually,
upon the whole extent of the Coast, the annual
loss of lives cannot be much less than
<i>Fifteen Thousand</i>.</p>

<p class='c019'>I am now to speak of the survivors.—When
the ships make the land, (usually the West-India
islands,) and have their port in view
after having been four, five, six weeks, or a
longer time, at sea, (which depends much
upon the time that passes before they can get
into the permanent Trade Winds, which blow
from the North-East and East across the Atlantic,)
then, and not before, they venture to
release the Men Slaves from their irons. And
then, the sight of the land, and their freedom
from long and painful confinement, usually
excite in them a degree of alacrity, and a
transient feeling of joy——</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The prisoner leaps to lose his chains.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>But, this joy is short-lived indeed. The
condition of the unhappy Slaves is in a continual
progress from bad to worse. Their case
is truly pitiable, from the moment they are
in a state of slavery, in their own country;
but it may be deemed a state of ease and liberty,
compared with their situation on board
our ships.</p>
<p class='c019'>Yet, perhaps, they would wish to spend the
remainder of their days on ship board,
could they know, before-hand, the nature of
the servitude which awaits them, on shore;
and that the dreadful hardships and sufferings
they have already endured, would, to the most
of them, only terminate in excessive toil,
hunger, and the excruciating tortures of the
cart-whip, inflicted at the caprice of an unfeeling
Overseer, proud of the power allowed
him of punishing whom, and when, and how
he pleases.</p>

<p class='c019'>I hope the Slaves, in our islands, are better
treated now, than they were, at the time
when I was in the trade. And even then, I
know, there were Slaves, who, under the care
and protection of humane masters, were, comparatively,
happy. But I saw and heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>enough to satisfy me, that their condition, in
general, was wretched to the extreme. However
my stay in Antigua and St. Christopher’s
(the only islands I visited) was too short, to
qualify me for saying much, from my own
certain knowledge; upon this painful subject.
Nor is it needful:—Enough has been offered
by several respectable writers, who have had
opportunity of collecting surer, and fuller information.</p>

<p class='c019'>One thing I cannot omit, which was told
me by the Gentleman to whom my ship was
consigned, at Antigua, in the year 1751,
and who was, himself, a Planter. He said,
that calculations had been made, with all
possible exactness, to determine which was
the preferable, that is, the most saving method
of managing Slaves:——</p>
<p class='c025'>“Whether, to appoint them moderate
work, plenty of provision, and such
treatment, as might enable them to
protract their lives to old age?” Or,</p>
<p class='c025'>“By rigorously straining their strength to
the utmost, with little relaxation,
hard fare, and hard usage, to wear
them out before they became useless,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>and unable to do service; and then,
to buy new ones, to fill up their
places?”</p>
<p class='c026'>He farther said, that these skilful calculators
had determined in favour of the latter
mode, as much the cheaper; and that he
could mention several estates, in the island of
Antigua, on which, it was seldom known,
that a Slave had lived above nine years.——<i>Ex
pede Herculem!</i></p>

<p class='c019'>When the Slaves are landed for sale, (for in
the Leeward Islands they are usually sold on
shore,) it may happen, that after a long separation
in different parts of the ship, when
they are brought together in one place, some,
who are nearly related, may recognize each
other. If, upon such a meeting, pleasure
should be felt, it can be but momentary.
The sale disperses them wide, to different
parts of the island, or to different islands.
Husbands and Wives, Parents and Children,
Brothers and Sisters, must suddenly part again,
probably to meet no more.</p>

<p class='c019'>After a careful perusal of what I have
written, weighing every paragraph distinctly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>I can find nothing to retract. As it is not
easy to write altogether with coolness, upon
this business, and especially not easy to me,
who have formerly been so deeply engaged
in it; I have been jealous, lest the warmth
of imagination might have insensibly seduced
me, to aggravate and overcharge some of the
horrid features, which I have attempted to
delineate, of the African Trade. But, upon
a strict review, I am satisfied.</p>

<p class='c019'>I have apprized the reader, that I write
from memory, after an interval of more than
thirty years. But at the same time, I believe,
many things which I saw, heard and felt,
upon the Coast of Africa, are so deeply engraven
in my memory, that I can hardly
forget, or greatly mistake them, while I am
capable of remembering any thing. I am
certainly not guilty of wilful misrepresentation.
And, upon the whole, I dare appeal
to the Great Searcher of hearts, in whose
presence I write, and before whom I, and
my readers, must all shortly appear, that
(with the restrictions and exceptions I have
made) I have advanced nothing, but what,
to the best of my judgement and conscience, is
true.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>I have likewise written without solicitation,
and simply from the motive I have already
assigned; a conviction, that the share I have
formerly had in the trade, binds me, in conscience,
to throw what light I am able upon
the subject, now it is likely to become a point
of Parliamentary investigation.</p>

<p class='c019'>No one can have less interest in it, than I
have at present, further than as I am interested
by the feelings of humanity, and a
regard for the honour, and welfare of my
country.</p>

<p class='c019'>Though unwilling to give offence to a single
person; in such a cause, I ought not to be
afraid of offending many, by declaring the
truth; if, indeed, there can be many, whom
even interest can prevail upon to contradict
the common sense of mankind, by pleading
for a commerce, so iniquitous, so cruel, so
oppressive, so destructive, as the African Slave
Trade!</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
